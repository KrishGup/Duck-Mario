# Level 1: “The Lost Nest”

**Setting:** The familiar Waddlewood Pond at dawn, just as Quackers discovers his nest has been raided. This level serves as an introduction, easing players into the controls and establishing the game’s premise.

**Objective:** Help Quackers start his journey by learning the basic mechanics and overcoming small obstacles. At the end of the level, he learns that Rascal and his raccoon band have taken the eggs further into the forest.

## Gameplay Loop

To create a fun, repeatable loop, let’s add **Collectible Water Lilies** as the unique mechanic:

- **Collectible Water Lilies:** Throughout the level, water lilies appear as collectibles scattered along Quackers’ path. Each lily collected rewards players with points, sound effects, or a small visual flourish (like a sparkle around Quackers). Collecting all the lilies in a level could unlock a bonus area or extra points, adding a fun, rewarding challenge without complicating gameplay.
- **Jumping and Attacking:** Quackers can jump over obstacles (rocks, logs) and use his “quack” attack to scare off small critters in his way, such as squirrels or frogs, adding a layer of engagement.

## Level Progression Breakdown

### 1. Starting Point: “The Empty Nest”

- **Cutscene (Optional):** Quackers discovers his empty nest. A short text pop-up appears: “Quackers’ eggs have been stolen by the raccoons! Help him recover his precious family.”
- **Introduction to Water Lilies:** The first few lilies appear here, allowing players to get familiar with collecting them.

### 2. Mid-Section: “The Overgrown Path”

- **Basic Obstacles:** Simple obstacles like logs, rocks, and small puddles, requiring players to time jumps carefully. 
- **Critter Encounters:** A few critters (like frogs or small birds) appear in Quackers' path, introducing the quack attack. Timing an attack rewards the player with a splash or sound effect, reinforcing its use.
- **More Water Lilies:** A small trail of lilies guides Quackers forward. Collecting them unlocks small hints or boosts (like showing the next enemy’s position briefly).

### 3. Reflection Pond: “Ripple Chase”

- **Simple Reflection Mechanic:** As Quackers moves, his reflection below shows any upcoming obstacles a moment ahead of time, creating a “heads-up” effect. This subtle mechanic helps players anticipate the next jump or attack, adding an intuitive but rewarding edge to gameplay without adding complexity.
- **Collectible Lilies as Guidance:** The lilies line up above and below (in the reflection), creating a satisfying, visually guided path.

### 4. End of Level: “Into the Woods”

- Quackers reaches the forest edge, and the scene pans to show Rascal the Raccoon running off with the eggs. A quick text pop-up hints at the raccoons’ motive: “Rascal believes these eggs hold magical power!”
- **Final Reward:** Collecting all lilies grants a small end-of-level bonus, like an extra quack sound or a congratulatory message encouraging players to move to the next level.

## Additional Accessibility Features for Level 1

- **Sound Cues:** Each lily collection triggers a soft sound cue, helping players know they’ve picked one up.
- **Color Contrast Adjustments:** Make sure the lilies and obstacles stand out distinctly against the background, aiding visibility for players with low vision.
- **Adjustable Speed Option:** Allow players to toggle between normal and slow speeds for accessibility, making auto-walking smoother for new players.
